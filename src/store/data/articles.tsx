        title: "What does the Bible say about drinking alcohol?",
        intro: "Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12). However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol. In fact, some passages of Scripture discuss alcohol in positive terms. Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing. Isaiah 55:1 encourages, “Yes, come buy wine and milk…",
        body: "What God commands Christians regarding alcohol is to avoid drunkenness (Ephesians 5:18). The Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35). Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be “mastered” by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19). Drinking alcohol in excess is undeniably addictive. Scripture also forbids a Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or encourage them to sin against their conscience (1 Corinthians 8:9-13). In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31). Jesus changed water into wine. It even seems that Jesus drank wine on occasion (John 2:1-11; Matthew 26:29). In New Testament times, the water was not very clean. Without modern sanitation, the water was often filled with bacteria, viruses, and all kinds of contaminants. The same is true in many developing countries today. As a result, people often drank wine (or grape juice) because it was far less likely to be contaminated. In 1 Timothy 5:23, Paul instructed Timothy to stop drinking water exclusively (which was probably causing his stomach problems) and instead drink wine. In that day, wine was fermented (containing alcohol), but not necessarily to the degree it is today. It is incorrect to say that it was grape juice, but it is also incorrect to say that it was the same thing as the wine commonly used today. Again, Scripture does not forbid Christians from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol. Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin. It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from (Ephesians 5:18; 1 Corinthians 6:12). Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive for most people—the exception being those who struggle with addiction. Some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom. Drunkenness and addiction are sin. However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing a brother to stumble, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol.",

        title: "Is homeschooling biblical?",
        intro: "Yes, homeschooling is biblical. A clunkier and more academic title for this article would be, “Discipleship, Education, and Schooling of Children: A Biblical Perspective.” I kind of like it but I am not writing for a philosophy journal right now. On the other hand, Christians must be scripturalists. That means, they must be philosophers because they must love wisdom.",
        body: "God’s Word, not the human experience. Where should Christians get wisdom? The Word of God. But very few – truly very few – Christians with whom I have ever talked about education start, travel, and end with God’s word when it comes to the education of children. Not church leaders, not parents, not professors of education at Christian colleges, and not certified teachers. But the Bible is where we must go on every topic. If only it were easier to do. What is “it”? How about trying to look at the word of God on a particular topic as if it were the first time, and as if you had not been biased by your family growing up, your local churches, your favorite Bible teachers, your friends of the past and present, your elementary and secondary school experiences, TV, and what all the experts say? It is not easy. But it is imperative that every Christian consider doing this on the topic of the discipleship of children. If not, a core aspect of what it means to live a Christian life is ignored and part of God’s best plan is lost. Historical context Many Christians try to come to terms with the education that is given to children and youth – about 86% of all children in the United States – in state-run (i.e., public) schools. (And the percentage of children in State/public schools in most nations is very high, the majority of children.) Some of these Christians have already sent their children away to public schools to be taught there, some are considering doing so, and some have grandchildren in them; others are church leaders who are trying to determine what counsel to give to parents about the education of their young. Along these lines, I saw an article by a nationally well-known Christian leader on this topic a few years back. I carefully read and thought long and hard about what he wrote. It was clear that he had struggled for years over the concept of who should be teaching, training, and indoctrinating children (i.e., educating them) and he was expressing himself to many thousands of people related to his sphere of influence. I had to conclude that his advice was murky and rife with historical, logical, biblical, and philosophical problems. I do not want to identify this man but I do want to give you some of what I wrote to him in a letter. First, from the very beginning, one of the main reasons for the founding and existence of “common schools” (i.e., what are now called public schools) in the United States was the control of one group of people (or one group’s vision) over another group of people. For example, historian of education Dr. Charles Glenn wrote the following: “In the United States, as in France and the Netherlands, the mission of the common school was defined largely in terms of the creation of convictions and loyalties, of shaping a common mind or soul for the nation” (p. 261). Homeschooling is biblical. It clearly allows and empowers and executes the biblical command for parents to raise up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord on a daily and hourly basis all week long.",

        title: "Should Christians homeschool their children?",
        intro: "The question of whether Christians should homeschool their children is one that many families wrestle with. The Bible tells us that children are a gift from the Lord, specially created for His pleasure and divine purpose (Psalm 127:3-5; 139:13-16). God has entrusted us with our children for a very short time, during which parents have the responsibility of training, instructing, nurturing, and disciplining them, as well as overseeing their education (Ephesians 6:4). It is imperative that Christian parents teach their children the Word of God from a young age, showing them how to incorporate it into their daily lives, trusting continually in God. Spiritual training is even more important than academic training, and it doesn’t happen by accident; it must be purposeful and habitual. The question is which mode of education will best accomplish these goals.",
        body: "Genesis 1 Day one – Heavens and earth are created. “Let there be light.” Day and Night. Day two – Atmospheric waters separated from earth waters. Day three – Land appears separating the seas. Vegetation is made. Day four – Sun, moon, stars are made. Day five – Sea life and birds are made. Day six – Land animals, creeping things, and man (male and female) are made. Genesis 2 States heaven and earth were created. There was no plant yet on earth, no rain yet, and no man. But, a mist rose watering the surface of the ground. Then the Lord formed man from dust of the ground and breagenesis creation 1 2thed into his nostrils the breath of life. Finally, God made Eve. There is no contradiction between Genesis 1 and 2. Genesis 1 is a detailed explanation of the six days of creation, day by day. Genesis two is a recap and a more detailed explanation of the sixth day, the day that Adam and Eve were made. The recap is stated in Gen. 2:4, “This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.” Then, Moses goes on to detail the creation of Adam and Eve as is seen in verses 7 through 24 of Gen. 2. Proof that it is not a creative account is found in the fact that animals aren’t even mentioned until after the creation of Adam. Why? Probably because their purpose was designated by Adam. They didn’t need to be mentioned until after Adam was created.",

        title: "What does the Bible say about women pastors?",
        intro: "There is perhaps no more hotly debated issue in the church today than that of women serving as pastors. As a result, it is important to not see this issue as men versus women. There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry. This is not a matter of chauvinism or discrimination. It is an issue of biblical interpretation.",
        body: "The Word of God proclaims, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent” (1 Timothy 2:11–12). In the church, God assigns different roles to men and women. This is a result of the way mankind was created and the way in which sin entered the world (1 Timothy 2:13–14). God, through the apostle Paul, restricts women from serving in roles of teaching and/or having spiritual authority over men. This precludes women from serving as pastors over men, since pastoring definitely includes preaching, teaching publicly, and exercising spiritual authority.",

        title: "What does the Bible say about tattoos?",
        intro: "Tattoos are more popular than ever in many parts of the world. The number of people with tattoos has increased dramatically in recent years. Tattoos are not just for delinquents or rebels anymore. The edginess of rebellion historically associated with tattoos is starting to wear off.",
        body: "We cannot leave the discussion of tattoos without looking at the Old Testament law that prohibited tattoos: “Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (Leviticus 19:28). The reason for the prohibition of tattoos in this passage is not stated, but it is likely that tattooing was a pagan practice connected with idolatry and superstition. It was probably common for the pagans to mark their skin with the name of a false god or with a symbol honoring some idol. God demanded that His children be different. As He reminded them in the same verse, “I am the LORD.” The Israelites belonged to Him; they were His workmanship, and they should not bear the name of a false god on their bodies. While New Testament believers are not under the Mosaic Law, we can take from this command the principle that, if a Christian chooses to get a tattoo, it should never be for superstitious reasons or to promote worldly philosophy. The bottom line is that getting a tattoo is not a sin, per se. It is a matter of Christian freedom and should be guided by biblical principles and rooted in love.",

        title: "What does the Bible say about interracial marriage?",
        intro: "The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4). However, the reason for this command was not skin color or ethnicity. Rather, it was religious. The reason God commanded against interracial marriage for the Jews was that foreign people were worshipers of false gods. The Israelites would be led astray if they intermarried with idol worshipers, pagans, or heathens. This is exactly what happened in Israel, according to Malachi 2:11.",
        body: "A couple considering marriage needs to weigh many factors. While a difference in ethnicity should not be ignored, it absolutely should not be the determining factor in whether a couple should marry. An interracial couple may face discrimination and ridicule, and they should be prepared to respond to such prejudice in a biblical manner. But marriage is honorable among all (Hebrews 13:4). Also, “there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him” (Romans 10:12). A colorblind church and/or a Christian interracial marriage can be a powerful illustration of our equality and oneness in Christ.",
